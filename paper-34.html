				<span class="captalized-text">T</span>he Antarctic continent is one of the most physically and chemically extremes of the planet. Micro-organisms can survive in this environment need to have mechanisms to adapt to temperature extremes and high incidence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). To study the microbial diversity in this environment is extremely important to understand how life survives in extremes on earth, and to explore the biotechnological potential of these organisms. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of UVR in bacteria isolated from Antarctic soil, characterize them as well as evaluate their biotechnological potential. The bacterial isolates were first characterized for colony morphology, growth at 30 ° C and photoperiod induction. The colonies had different characteristics, including different textures and pigments. The isolates were classified in Psychrophiles (71%) and Psychrotrophs (29%). Growth curves were in order to determine the growth phase of each isolate. The evaluation of the effects of UVR was performed in two steps. The first consisted of a screening, in that the isolates were irradiated in LB liquid medium at doses of 300, 600 and 1200J / m. and subjected to optical density reading. In the first step, ten isolates were resistant to UVR. In the second step, these isolates were irradiated in buffer, plated for colony counting and making survival curves, relating N/N0 in function of time and dose. All ten grew over time after incidence of radiation with different rates of recovery. However, only five exhibited growth when subjected to curve relating the doses, showing the difficulty of recovery of cells is higher when they are inoculated directly into a solid medium. Isolates have also been molecularly characterized by the use of restriction enzymes and sequencing the gene encoding 16S rRNA, which resulted in the identification of seven distinct genera. Finally, were evaluated for their potential biotechnological applications, from two tests of extracellular enzyme activity, which also examined the effect of UVR on enzyme production. In the first semiquantitative test were observed activity of amylases and proteases, but the effects of UVR was not significant. In the second qualitative test, five isolates showed alterations (presence/absence) of enzyme activity when exposed to UVR. The results obtained in this work allowed the selection of photo-resistant strains, characterizing them phenotypically and molecularly, as well as evaluate their enzymatic production at low temperatures.
