			<h3>Identification and Characterization of Bacterial Isolates from King George Island, Antarctica.</h3>

				<span class="captalized-text">B</span>ecause of their territorial isolation, Antarctica is presented as a continent to be unveiled, characterized by extremes of climate, habitat and biogeography. In a restrictive environment, biogeochemical cycles and food chains come to be exclusively formed by micro-organisms. This continent is presented as a single source for research in bacterial taxonomy, because the knowledge in this area are still very poor, especially in a difficult environment marked by adversity. In this context, the present work aim to isolate and characterize bacteria from different soils of King George Island. We sought to select strains creating a profile of growth, biochemical and enzymatic characterization evaluating their possible biotechnological applications. Samples were obtained from collections in the Antarctic summer of 2006/2007, and processed in the chemical module EACF (Station Antarctic Comandante Ferraz). Initially we obtained 113 bacterial isolates. Taking into account the morphological parameters and time of growth at temperatures of 4 and 25 ° C, thirty isolates were selected and had their DNA extracted and amplified using primers for BOX-PCR. They were then tested for obtaining the growth curves, first on board, where 16 strains grew in 48hs at 4 º C, and then using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 640 nm. Then their activities in culture media containing casein, starch, gelatin and CMC (at 4 and 25 C) were studied, as well as biochemical analysis performed in commercial kits (API Biomerieux) also at 4 º C. Then the DNA of representatives of each group was amplified with primers specific for the 16S rRNA and the amplicons were then sequenced. The results indicate the presence of bacterial species in Antarctica (<i>Antarticobacter</i> sp. <i>Psychrobacter cryoalolentis, Algoriphagus antarcticus</i>) and also undescribed species. The tests indicated that seven isolates have the capacity to maintain protein activity at good levels, shown by the precipitation of gelatin, and of those seven, six strains can degrade the casein present in the culture medium at 4 ° C. Moreover, the tests showed that six other strains were able to solubilize phosphate through the same temperature analyzed. With the results, we see great opportunities to identify new species and good biotechnological applications due to the levels of adaptation observed in different conditions.
