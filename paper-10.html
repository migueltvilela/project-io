			<h3>Morphological characterization of magnetotactic bacteria from Almirantado Bay, Antarctic</h3>
			<p class="author">Roberta Santoro de Magalhães</p>

				<p class="pretext">Abstract</p>
				<span class="captalized-text">M</span>agnetotactic bacteria are able to respond to magnetic fields due to the presence of nanomagnetic particles rich in iron in their cytoplasm, called magnetosomes. These organelles are usually arranged in chains and are responsible for the orientation of magnetotactic bacteria along the geomagnetic field. These bacteria are commonly found in aquatic environments, but only recently in extreme environments. This study aimed to characterize and analyze the morphology and phylogeny of magnetotactic bacteria from Almirantado Bay, which is located in central George Island, belonging to the archipelago's South Shetland Islands. Samples of water and sediment were collected during the XVII and XXVIII Operation Antartica, during February – March 2009, and November 2009, and February 2010, respectively, as part of Project Microbial Diversity of Terrestrial and Maritime Ecosystems in Antartic Peninsula – MIDIAPI. The collected sediment and water were placed in a suitable container for magnetic concentration, which was exposed to a magnetic field generated by a coil. This process results in the obtainment of a solution highly concentrated in magnetotactic bacteria, which was used for the experiments. The samples were processed for transmission electron microscopy followed by image analysis, in order to determine the morphological characteristics of magnetotactic bacteria. During the assessment carried out in the XVII and XXVIII Antarctic operations, referred to here as the sampling I and II, respectively, it was possible to observe different morphotypes of magnetotactic bacteria. In both samplings we observed the presence of magnetotactic spirillum, cocci and rods. The predominant morphotype found in samples from the sampling I and II was coccos with two chains of magnetosomes, followed by coccos with disorganized magnetosomes and then by those presenting four chains of magnetosomes. In sampling II coccos containing four chains of magnetosomes were rarely observed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the gene encoding the 16S rRNA indicates that the initial preparation of the sample, i.e. the magnetic concentration and subsequent washing of the sample must be modified because there are a large number of sequences not related to magnetotactic bacteria. The scatter plot for length and width of magnetosomes of the magnetotatic coccos with two and four chains of magnetosomes and disorganized magnetosomes indicate similar characteristics for these structures. For these reason it is not possible to identify bacterial species based on magnetosome’s dimensions. This work extends the general concept of magnetotactic bacteria, it presents the first description of magnetotactic bacteria found in Antarctic, because its shows that they live in low temperature, and also not just psichrophilic mesophilic or moderately thermophilic, as described in the literature.
