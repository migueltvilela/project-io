			<h3>Evaluation of Bioremediation Techniques for Soil around the Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (EACF), Admiralty Bay-Antarctic.</h3>

				<p class="pretext">Abstract</p>
				<span class="captalized-text">M</span>any areas on the Antarctic continent already suffer with the direct and indirect influences caused by human activities. The Antarctic Peninsula is part of the maritime Antarctic and presents itself as the region with the greatest problems of contamination by various compounds, including hydrocarbons, heavy metals and organochlorine compounds. In this respect, the present study aims to evaluate some treatments for bioremediation (Biostimulation, Bioaugmentation and Bioaugmentation + Bioestímulation) using soils from around the Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (EACF). The energy generated is sourced are in diesel, which gets stored next to the station. The transport and supply of vehicles and the station itself lead to frequent accidental spills that create a chronic contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons. In addition, a defect present in a valve in a storage tank of diesel fuel spilled in the soil near the station approximately 20,000 liters of oil in 1986 what drastically affected the site and 25 years after the incident signals this accident are still easily perceptible. Thus, this study evaluated the conditions that this soil is exposed and mounted an experiment <i>in situ</i> with the objective to test bioremediation techniques using micro-organisms to eliminate and / or reduce toxicity and contamination levels in the soil. The study tested techniques of Biostimulation, and Bioaumetation biostimulation + Bioaumentation in three models of soil: Soil with a history of contamination by diesel oil (SC), soil with a history of contamination by diesel oil + 2% of diesel oil and soil without contamination by diesel oil. The experiment lasted for 45 days and at the end of this period the soil was frozen at-20°C and brought to Brazil, where chemical and molecular analyse were performed, among them the quantification of carbon and nitrogen, DGGE gel (with gradient denaturation), real-time PCR and quantification of total hydrocarbons and polyaromatic. Molecular tests evaluated changes in the profile and quantity of the rrs genes of archaea and bacteria, and <i>alk</i>B gene. The results show that type of soil studied had great influence on the molecular profiles found for each treatment. The bacterial strains were isolated and sequenced previously identified as belonging to genera with the potential for bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons already known, such as <i>Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter</i>. The influence of the treatments tested was directly related to the type of soil used. The work confirmed that despite the extreme conditions found in Antarctica were bacterial strains capable of degrading hydrocarbons and bioremediation treatments that directly influence microbial communities present in these soils even in short periods. In addition, we found that there is great difference in the response to treatment depending on the time it takes after the contamination, to perform the remediation. Thus, we understand the importance of having a prior knowledge about recovery measures contaminated environments in polar regions, since time can be crucial to the recovery levels and the application of these soils leads to immediate rapid and satisfactory.
